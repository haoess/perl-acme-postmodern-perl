=head1 NAME

Acme::Postmodern::Perl - Postmodern Perl solves all problems

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.07

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::Postmodern::Perl;

This module requires the next upcoming stable perl version.

=head1 HOW TO INSTALL (or: how to give it a try, at least)

L<CPAN>.pm and its friends (like L<App::cpanminus>) don't play nicely with the
C<package NAMESPACE VERSION> syntax (which was introduced in perl5 v12). So if
you want to get the latest version of this distribution, you have to download it
directly from your nearby CPAN mirror.
